# 🖍️ Odin Etch-A-Sketch

A browser-based twist on the beloved Etch-A-Sketch from the “good ol’ days”!

This project is a part of **The Odin Project JavaScript Foundations** track. It focuses on DOM manipulation, Flexbox layout, and `for` loop logic to dynamically generate interactive grids.

## 🍃 Features

* Dynamically generates grid elements using `document.createElement()`

* Builds a fully responsive grid via `for` loop logic

* Prompts the user to select grid size for interactivity

* Includes random color trails using `Math.random()`

## 🕯️ Lessons Learned 

* Using `for` loops to create elements, not just iterate over existing ones

* How to research and apply **external code examples** (like random color generation)

* Combining **JavaScript + Flexbox** to maintain structure within a fixed container

* Understanding how to **clear and rebuild DOM elements** dynamically
